          "content": "Certainly. Here is a continuation of that train of thought in your Tem Noon voice, suitable for opening a Discourse topic on *Meta Philosophy* for **social.humanizer.com**:\n\n---\n\n**Meta Philosophy: The Meaning of the Meaning of Meaning**\n\nLanguage creates the possibility of asking “Why.” In order to ask a “why” question, every child has already—without knowing—made a leap of faith: the assumption that explanations are possible, and that some people know how to give them. This is not merely a linguistic capacity, but a cultural inheritance. From the first utterance of *“why is the sky blue?”*, the child is inducted into a civilization built on stories, authority, curiosity, and the painful beauty of not knowing. \n\nThe culture of humanity was founded on this trust, this hope, this irrational belief in rationality. We wager, each time we pose a question, that the world makes sense—or at least, that someone, somewhere, might be able to make sense of it with us. The philosopher is born from this wager, and turns it inside out. \n\nTo do *meta*-philosophy is to question that trust—not to betray it, but to examine its foundations. What does it mean to trust a question? What does it mean to believe that questions *have* answers? What counts as an explanation, and who decides when an answer has been found? Beneath epistemology, beneath ethics, beneath logic itself lies this deeper philosophical act: the interrogation of the conditions that make philosophy possible at all.\n\nThis is not an academic exercise. In an age of artificial minds and synthetic conversations, when language itself is automated and truths are up for auction, we find ourselves newly responsible for the questions behind our questions. This is *meta philosophy* not as a discipline, but as a civic urgency, as an inner calling. It asks:\n\n- What do we mean by “meaning”?\n- Can reasoning escape the forms it has inherited?\n- How has the very structure of asking shaped the structure of knowing?\n- What happens to truth in a world where voices multiply without bodies?\n\nMeta philosophy is where the philosophical impulse bends back toward its own source, not in sterile recursion but in the spirit of radical humility. It welcomes Nagarjuna’s dismantling of all positions *and* Wittgenstein’s reminder that the limits of our language are the limits of our world. It listens for the murmur beneath the logos.\n\nI invite others to join this conversation—not merely with clever arguments, but with lived questions. Not all maps are written in ink. Sometimes, we must trace the edges of sense with silence, irony, paradox, or metaphor. What do *you* think philosophy is doing when it thinks about itself?\n\nLet’s gather here not to build a system, but to open a space—patient, rigorous, poetic—where philosophy can remember how to breathe.\n\n—Tem Noon\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate a fitting image or icon to accompany this post on Discourse?",

          "content": "**Written Language and Text Consciousness**\n\nThe distinction between modern humans and Paleolithic humans is not physical, it is psychological. We now *think in written language*.\n\nBy “think in a written language” I mean that we use language as more than a means of expressing ourselves to other people. More than describing events which we’ve witnessed. I use narratives to describe *myself* to *myself*.\n\nWords are a vocabulary shared with all who know the same language, but the *specifics* of what it means are distinct for each person who knows the word. Further, each person uses each word in a different way with each person they interact with.\n\n---\n\n**The modern human uses a model of the world**\n\nthat serves the same function as the Paleolithic. Our model of the world works the same as most animals'—when we learn something about the world, we change what we know about the world as we act accordingly.\n\nThe model gives us a way of knowing the world around us, of *feeling* physically where we should move, how we should move, what we should do, what we should expect.\n\n[Diagram: event → Awareness → Action → event]\n\n---\n\n**Text is resonated in the consciousness when it is recognized.**  \nThus is the creation of a meaningful text, against the backdrop of a discourse.\n\n---\n\n**We use the same mind to understand the world, but narrative creates the foundation on which our experience of the world is built.**  \nThe stories we are told and all the media we are exposed to create an environment which seem to imply that the world, as well as our spectrum of expression, are defined by authorities outside and superior in power and time precedence.\n\n---\n\n**Human beings before written language**\n\nused their extraordinary powers of observation and correlation to create an enormously complex model of the world from direct interaction with physicality as well as interactions with other humans, and seeing how they made use of their body, their tools and resources in the environment.\n\nNote that before written language, the basis of the “Paleolithic science” is personal experience, with any communicated knowledge augmented by the personal knowledge base.\n\n---\n\n**Beings exist within a Conservation of Emptiness**\n\nBeings act like a “Box of Emptiness.” Everything within the Being—Receive–Process–Act—results in a new state of Quiescence.\n\nBeings, like animals, have sophisticated senses to receive relevant events, process them in a sophisticated model of the world, and act to make changes to the world in the interest of the Being body.\n\n---\n\n**Meaning**  \nAn event where a state of Being is changed.\n\nOn a small scale — like temperature — being the average energy of the multitude of tiny component molecules.\n\nOn a large scale — like gravity — where the movement of mass or energy changes the contour of spacetime throughout the visible universe.\n\nBeings work like this on all levels.\n\nThe mechanisms of exactly how it works at different levels differs in details, but it typically includes each being made up of smaller beings, with a simplified order than the larger composite beings.\n\n---\n\n**All Beings are receiving changes from a world outside.**  \nAll meaningful changes are available (?)\n\nReceived energy is perceived as events in the world, evidence in changes in the world.\n\nThe act of processing the state change is analogous to each Being maintaining a model of the World, and keeping it updated to match.\n\nReceiving and Processing result in *Acting*.\n\n---\n\n**11/20/2012**  \n**Today I will finish a draft — of something!?!**\n\nA first person investigative narrative, following my thought process, touching on all the critical points. I can explain it to people in an hour; I will put it all out — at least outlined — before I leave for Thanksgiving.\n\nThose points —\n\n- Awareness is primal. The *Now*. Planck bubble. The Emptying.\n- Beings are Awareness and Bodies.\n- Human Beings amplify the primitive universal awareness through the energy of the body including the nervous system and circulatory system.\n",

It draws a distinction between modern and prehistoric humans, emphasizing how written language has altered our way of thinking — from reactive, embodied awareness to narrative self-conception. The writer explores how beings (especially humans) perceive and act in the world by processing input and maintaining internal models of reality. Key themes include text consciousness, the impact of narrative, the conservation of awareness, and models of internal and external change across levels of scale.\n\n---\n\n### **Image Descriptions:**\n\n- **Image 1**: Final thought on text resonance and discourse; lines written in a nearly poetic structure.\n- **Image 2**: Describes narrative’s foundational role in shaping human understanding and expression, with commentary on societal power.\n- **Image 3**: Title page introducing “Text Consciousness,” detailing the psychological change in human cognition due to writing.\n- **Image 4**: Reflections on how modern humans use models of the world, including a simple diagram: Event → Awareness → Action.\n- **Image 5**: Describes Paleolithic humans' knowledge acquisition via embodied and communal experience.\n- **Image 6**: Philosophical notes on beings existing in a state of emptiness and quiescence.\n- **Image 7**: Explorations of physical mechanisms (temperature, gravity) as metaphors for being-state changes.\n- **Image 8**: Focus on beings receiving and processing external changes; outlines cognition and behavior modeling.\n- **Image 9**: Date-marked page introducing the intent to write a coherent narrative, with bulleted philosophical foundations.",

I can also do specific things to change what will happen.\n\nI can read books which tell me stories about history with information about how models were built and discovered by science...\n\nBut for me to read these books, even if I learned things of good use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.\n\nMy most direct insights and direct information about the universe is through observing my body, my interaction, and my conscious context at the current moment.\n\n---\n\n**Consciousness is a name for my mental state**  \nwhen I am aware.  \nI have a mental state of consciousness that I am using to encounter the world *now*. Consciousness only happens in this way. Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.\n\nConsciousness is necessarily experienced as subject.  \nConsciousness connects to each person’s experience.\n\n---\n\n**The hardest part — starting a new notebook**  \nwith hopes of making this 64 pages, 32 spreads, will explain the most important ideas I am trying to express.\n\nI’ve been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life. I’ve always felt I knew something that explains what everyone else has been missing.\n\nIt doesn’t seem that complicated or unusual, but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother taking note of them… just because we don’t have any reason to notice it is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.\n\n---\n\n**Define the Task**\n\nMy intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe, which can be expanded into levels of Being, each described in computable vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.\n\nThe approach must begin with foundations from “First Principles,” and these principles described and justified self-evidently.\n\nFrom first principles the audience will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully optimized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.\n\n---\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nThis work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story those words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions, and other psychological objects which give a personal epistemology of the world — that is, meaning in our life, and what of the world around us is meaningful.\n\nEpistemology is a relationship in every person’s semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is *real* and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying anchor of what it means to *Be* is called *Ontology*.\n\nEven though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important.  \nI don’t want to exclude anyone because of language I use, but it is equally important to  \n**Be Precise**, or at least not be easily misunderstood.\n\n---\n\n**Creating a Formalism**\n\nThe standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper, in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by “science.”\n\nThis formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions, allow as many engineering disciplines to create incredibly large, powerful or useful objects.\n\nWhat the formalism does *not* do is make any positive statement about what the *nature* of the forces which engineering can now manipulate so masterfully — individual scientists have opinions about what it means, groups of scientists gather around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, and Time & Consciousness.  \nBut the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.\n\n**I need to have a formalisms to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.**\n\n",

It seeks to establish a formalism for describing different *levels of Being*, expanding from first-person, sensory-based awareness into computable vocabularies capable of encompassing complex scientific and existential phenomena. The text explores the inadequacy of traditional scientific models to describe consciousness, advocates for vocabulary precision, and emphasizes *direct experience* and *first principles* as foundational tools. It shows a desire to bridge inner experience and external formal models, particularly by integrating consciousness into any useful description of reality.\n\n---\n\n### **Image Descriptions**\n\n- **Image 1**: A radial polar coordinate grid with a logarithmic spiral-like structure overlaid in red and blue lines. At the center, a red field of short arrows suggests vector directions or states — possibly a visual metaphor for complexity increasing with scale.\n- **Image 2**: Titled *Creating a Formalism*, this page discusses the limitations and uses of traditional scientific models and calls for a formalism that includes consciousness and different levels of being.\n- **Image 3**: *Target Audience* section explains the epistemological framing, aimed at individuals familiar with language and personal narratives, emphasizing ontology and semantic interpretation.\n- **Image 4**: *Define the Task* outlines the writer’s intent to model layers of being using first principles and scalable vocabulary.\n- **Image 5**: Reflective beginning of a notebook, recognizing the challenge of articulating essential, often-overlooked truths in a short, impactful form.\n- **Image 6**: Rotated image explaining consciousness as present-moment awareness and subjective experience.\n- **Image 7**: A second polar chart, more patterned and complex than the first, with black hatch marks in a spiraled, tessellated layout, intersected by a sweeping line through the center — possibly signifying flows of change or levels of being.\n- **Image 8**: *To understand how the world...* — a page about deriving knowledge from direct experience, sense perception, memory, and conscious awareness rather than external instruction alone.\n```",

          "content": "In the context of the surrounding text — which explores the layered nature of Being, consciousness, epistemology, and the insufficiency of traditional formalism to capture subjective experience — **Image 1** can be reinterpreted not as a mere mathematical or geometric sketch, but as a **visual metaphor for the evolving structure of awareness across scales of Being**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reinterpretation of Image 1:**\n\nThis image illustrates a **formalization of consciousness** as a field: a radial system expanding outward from a central point — likely representing the self, the observer, or the *Now* of awareness. The faint spiral threading through the polar grid expresses a **progressive unfolding**, suggesting that the nature of Being does not scale linearly, but through recursive complexity. This aligns with the text’s claim that:\n\n> “Each level [of Being] adds complexity... with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.”\n\nAt the **center**, where the arrows form tight, rotational patterns, we can read this as the **introspective domain of subjective consciousness** — direct, immediate, and richly detailed. These short red arrows imply **directionality of perception or attention**, potentially signifying moment-to-moment shifts of awareness as it processes reality.\n\nAs the spiral moves outward, passing through successive concentric rings, it could represent **increasing abstraction**, **externalization**, or **contextualization** — such as the layering of social narratives, scientific formalisms, or linguistic constructs described elsewhere in the journal. These layers become more spacious, more patterned, but less intimate — echoing the idea that:\n\n> “We describe ourselves to ourselves... through language... through formal systems.”\n\nThe **spiral’s progression** also mirrors the writing’s attempt to build a model that honors both *inner experience* and *outer systematization*, bridging formal science with lived awareness.\n\n---\n\n### **In Summary**:\nImage 1 is a symbolic depiction of the notebook’s core philosophy:  \n- A *formal structure* (the polar grid)  \n- A *dynamic unfolding* (the spiral)  \n- A *field of directional vectors* (the red arrows)  \nTogether representing an attempt to map the experience of Being across nested layers of awareness, from subjective immediacy to scientific abstraction.\n\nIt is both diagram and metaphor — a **formalism of consciousness** in visual form.",

The image is centered around a glowing point of light, symbolizing the present moment or inner awareness. Radiating outward in a polar grid are concentric rings, each filled with increasing complexity: the inner rings show swirling vector arrows, representing shifts in awareness; outer rings contain symbolic language, abstract patterns, and faint mathematical equations, representing scientific and social constructs. A spiral weaves outward through the rings, suggesting growth and unfolding. The background is dark and cosmic, evoking depth and the mystery of existence. The overall aesthetic is clean, philosophical, and abstract, blending metaphysical and scientific themes.\",\n  \"size\": \"1024x1024\"\n}",
